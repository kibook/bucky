Bucky is a CGI-based Gopher <-> HTTP proxy utility for the Bucktooth
Gopher server. It runs on top of an existing HTTP server to provide
access to your Bucktooth Gopherhole via HTTP.

Bucky uses buckd's -isproxy feature rather than opening sockets
and connecting to buckd like a gopher client.

It takes a QUERY_STRING in the form of "#/SELECTOR", where # is
the Gopher item type of the resource. For resources like menus or
search results, it builds an HTML version.

Running as a normal CGI script, requests may look like:

  http://mysite.com/bucky.cgi?0/mytextfile.txt

which would request /mytextfile.txt from the Gopher server,
displaying it in plain text. If your HTTP server can "rewrite"
requests (such as Apache's mod_rewrite), Bucky can be told to
masquerade links appropriately such that Gopher-URI-like requests are
handled by the Gopher server and Bucky transparently. For example:

  http://mysite.com/0/mytextfile.txt

could be accompished under Apache mod_rewrite with rules like:

  RewriteRule "^/$" "/bucky.cgi"
  RewriteRule "^/(.)/(.*)$" "/bucky.cgi?$1/$2"

and USE_REWRITE + REWRITE_ROOT will tell Bucky how to build
appropriate URLs for all links. (see comments under USE_REWRITE and
REWRITE_ROOT in config.h)
